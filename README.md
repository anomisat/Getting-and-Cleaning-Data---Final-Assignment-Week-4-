# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Final-Assignment-Week-4-

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 81-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The code book includes the following information:
=========================================

-  features_info: Shows information about the variables used in the analysis.
-  description of all variables and summaries calculated

The analysis undertaken by run_analysis.R script does the following:
=========================================

- reads all train and test files
- merges the columns for both train and test sets that are needed for the analysis - activity name, subject and the acceleration statistics
- sets the train and test sets to create one data set
- labels the activities properly
- labels each variable with a descriptive name
- creates a new data set that extracts only mean and standard deviation variables
- summarizes the data set from the previous step so that the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject is calculated

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
